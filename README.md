# Grab-safety
This is project is for 2019 Grab AI challenge.
## Problem description
We aim to categorize car trips as being dangerous or normal based on a set of features:
- Accuracy : the accuracy of GPS
- Bearing : the GPS bearing
- Acceleration_x : the acceleration on x axis
- Acceleration_y : the acceleration on y axis
- Acceleration_z : the acceleration on z axis
- Gyro_x : the gyroscope on x axis
- Gyro_y : the gyroscope on y axis
- Gyro_z : the gyroscope on z axis
- Speed : the velocity
- Second : the time when the record is taken
